                From boardroom prestige in Nigeria to volunteer roles in
                Maryland, Participant 2â€™s journey reflects the quiet anguish of
                a seasoned expert forced to start over. A 74-year-old chartered
                accountant and IT auditor with over three decades of leadership,
                his migration for family reunification collided with the
                systemic undervaluation of African credentials, ageist bias, and
                racial microaggressions. Despite holding 28 professional
                skillsets and once chairing a top firm, he found himself
                sidelined in a society that saw his qualifications as excess
                baggage. Yet through volunteerism, mentorship, and relentless
                adaptation, he continues to assert his value in spaces that
                rarely acknowledge it. His story embodies the resilience of
                elder immigrants whose legacies are too often eclipsed by the
                shadows of American gatekeeping.
