            The findings support the view that migration and integration are
            multidimensional processes influenced by both structural forces and
            individual agency. Theoretically, this study strengthens frameworks

            Without such interventions, the US risks underutilizing the immense
            talent and potential of African immigrant populations.

            Pitfalls, Contradictions, and Gaps Identified
          </p>

            While there was significant thematic overlap among participants,
            some contradictions emerged:
          </p>
          <ul className=" list-disc list-outside pl-4">
            <li>
              A few participants reported
              <span className=" font-bold">
                positive assimilation experiences and smooth professional
                reintegration,
              </span>
              especially those in IT and specialized healthcare fields where
              foreign skills are more easily recognized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants who migrated at a younger age or through structured
              professional programs (e.g., student visas, employer sponsorships)
              appeared to face fewer barriers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These contradictions suggest that factors such as
            <span className=" font-bold">
              field of specialization, age at migration,
            </span>
            and <span className=" font-bold"> migration </span> pathway play
            critical roles in shaping immigrant outcomesâ€”an area that warrants
            deeper exploration in future research.
          </p>
          <div className="">

              In addition, while the study heavily drew from narratives in
              Maryland, its findings may not fully generalize to Nigerian
              immigrants in less diverse states with fewer African community
              networks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journey of highly educated Nigerian immigrants in Maryland is
              emblematic of broader systemic issues in US immigration and labor
              systems. While personal resilience and adaptability are admirable
              and often heroic, they are insufficient substitutes for systemic
              change. Credential recognition, equitable hiring practices, and
              culturally sensitive support services are urgently needed to allow
              immigrants to thrive rather than merely survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, addressing the barriers outlined in this study is not
              just a matter of immigrant welfare but of justice, equity, and
              tapping into the full potential of America's increasingly diverse
              and globalized talent pool.
