            This study set out to explore the
            <span className=" font-bold">
              career development, cultural assimilation,
            </span>
            and
            <span className=" font-bold">social integration experiences</span>
            of highly educated Nigerian immigrants living in Maryland against
            the backdrop of a persistent phenomenon of overqualification and
            underemployment among African immigrants in the United States., the
            findings reveal that while these immigrants are remarkably
            resilient, ambitious, and adaptive, drawing from rich narrative
            interviews and extensive literature, they face significant
            structural and cultural barriers that limit their full professional
            fulfilment and socio-economic stability.

            For many participants, migration was motivated by a combination of
            <span className=" font-bold">push factors </span> such as
            <span className=" font-bold">
              insecurity, political instability,
            </span>
            and <span className=" font-bold"> professional stagnation </span> in
            Nigeria and <span className=" font-bold"> pull factors </span> like
            the
            <span className=" font-bold">
              perceived opportunities for education, safety,
            </span>
            and <span className=" font-bold"> career growth </span>
            in the United States. However, the professional landscape
            encountered often did not align with expectations. Systemic barriers
            such as credential devaluation, restrictive licensing processes,
            implicit racial biases, and cultural dislocation created a
            challenging environment that undermined immigrants' aspirations and
            forced many into cycles of underemployment and career reinvention.

            <span className=" font-bold">Thematic </span> and
            <span className=" font-bold">sub-thematic </span> analyses highlight
            how
            <span className=" font-bold">
              identity negotiation, emotional health struggles,
            </span>
            and <span className=" font-bold"> family obligations </span> form an
            integral part of the immigrant experience. Navigating dual cultural
            and economic expectations placed immense psychological and financial
            pressure on participants, demonstrating that migration is not merely
            a physical relocation but an ongoing process of adaptation,
            resilience, and negotiation of selfhood. Despite these challenges,
            the participants' stories also showcase profound examples of
            strategic reinvention, community building, and entrepreneurial
            spirit, emphasizing their agency in the face of systemic adversity.

            The findings not only corroborate existing scholarship on African
            immigrant labor market integration but also fill critical gaps by
            offering a localized, narrative-driven, and emotionally nuanced
            understanding of immigrant experiences in Maryland. They underscore
            the limitations of personal effort alone in overcoming entrenched
            systemic barriers and make clear the urgent need for structural
            reforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If highly educated African immigrants are to fulfil their potential
            and contribute fully to the American economy and society, deliberate
            policy interventions are necessary. These include reforms in
            credential recognition systems, stronger enforcement of
            anti-discrimination laws in employment, the establishment of
            mentorship programs tailored to immigrant professionals, and greater
            community-based support initiatives that address both professional
            development and mental health needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, this study highlights that the integration of African
            immigrant talent is not simply a matter of individual adjustment but
            a test of America's commitment to equity, inclusion, and the fair
            valuation of global human capital. Recognizing, supporting, and
            empowering immigrant professionals is not just a moral imperative —
            it is an economic and social necessity in a world that is
            increasingly interconnected and interdependent.
