            The challenges identified in this study, ranging from certification
            hurdles to mental health strainâ€”are interrelated components of a
            broader systemic issue: the underutilization of highly skilled
            immigrant talent in the United States. The policy recommendations
            outlined above draw from participants' narratives and lived
            experiences and are aimed at correcting inefficiencies in workforce
            integration, improving immigrant well-being, and creating inclusive
            economic opportunities. As a microcosm of the national immigrant
            experience, Maryland benefits significantly from such reforms,
            setting a model for other states with growing African immigrant
            populations. These proposed interventions would empower immigrant
            professionals and enrich the broader US economy by fully harnessing
            the potential of its diverse workforce.
