    story:
      "From boardroom prestige in Nigeria to volunteer roles in Maryland, Participant 2’s journey reflects the quiet anguish of a seasoned expert forced to start over. A 74-year-old chartered accountant and IT auditor with over three decades of leadership, his migration for family reunification collided with the systemic undervaluation of African credentials, ageist bias, and racial microaggressions. Despite holding 28 professional skillsets and once chairing a top firm, he found himself sidelined in a society that saw his qualifications as excess baggage. Yet through volunteerism, mentorship, and relentless adaptation, he continues to assert his value in spaces that rarely acknowledge it. His story embodies the resilience of elder immigrants whose legacies are too often eclipsed by the shadows of American gatekeeping.",

    story:
      "Once a top-level hospital administrator in Nigeria, Participant 3 came to the U.S. expecting professional continuity—but instead found himself restarting as a caregiver and later a program coordinator in disability services. Despite decades of experience, he confronted credential rejection, accent bias, and the heartbreak of managing two economies—one in dollars, the other in naira. Still, he rebuilds with quiet resilience, determined to turn his expertise into advocacy for policy reform.",

    story:
      'A seasoned financial controller in Nigeria, Participant 9 fled rising insecurity and economic chaos to protect her children’s future. In Maryland, she traded corporate spreadsheets for caregiving gloves—documenting health charts instead of managing ledgers. Her career may have paused, but her purpose didn\'t. Despite early experiences of racial rejection and family back home thinking she n"picks dollars off the streets,n" she holds fast to her dream of becoming a U.S.-licensed tax consultant.',

      "I don’t believe in waiting for the system to fix itself. If you dislike your situation enough, you’ll do something about it—and that’s what I did.",
    story:
      "Participant 11’s journey from agriculture graduate to cybersecurity specialist captures the quiet strength of a man who rebuilt his career one certification at a time. Starting out as a parking cashier earning minimum wage, he retrained strategically, pursued over ten IT certifications, and rose into a fulfilling cybersecurity role with the State of Maryland. While others lament systemic barriers, he credits his growth to mindset, discipline, and relentless learning. His story is a testament to the immigrant spirit—one that adapts, evolves, and thrives with clarity of purpose.",
