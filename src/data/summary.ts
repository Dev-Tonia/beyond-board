    storySummary:
      "The participant, a 35-year-old Nigerian male with a master’s degree obtained in Nigeria, has lived in Maryland, United States, for nearly three years. Before migrating, he worked as a Special Educational Needs Coordinator in Nigeria and had ambitions to specialize in pediatric physical therapy. His decision to move to the United States was driven by the perception of it as a land of opportunity, particularly Maryland, known for its academic institutions and research facilities. Upon arrival, he faced significant professional and personal challenges. These included the need to 'start all over again,' working low-wage jobs despite his qualifications. Currently employed as a personal care assistant and medical billing administrator, he feels only a small portion of his skills and qualifications are being utilized. He noted that foreign qualifications are often undervalued in the US job market, requiring immigrants to work harder to prove their competence. Despite holding substantial experience, the participant is required to retake prerequisite courses in the US before beginning a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program. He is currently completing the final courses and expects to start his DPT program soon. Culturally, he acknowledges significant differences between Nigeria and the United States especially in terms of values and social interactions. However, he has embraced cultural adaptation by selectively integrating aspects of American culture that align with his values. Communication has not posed a major barrier, and access to African stores has eased food-related adjustments. Professionally, he has not experienced major cultural clashes but emphasized the importance of respect and workplace ethics, which are similar to those in Nigeria. He credits his church community, particularly the Deeper Life Young Adults group, for providing crucial guidance on navigating his career path in the US, including choosing the most efficient route toward becoming a physical therapist. Economically, he struggles with the dual burden of supporting family members in Nigeria while managing personal expenses in the US. Remittances significantly impact his finances, and he has adopted budgeting and multiple jobs as strategies to cope. He also sets limits on financial support to maintain balance. For successful integration, he recommends that highly educated Nigerian immigrants return to school in the US to build local qualifications and networks. He believes that rejoining academic institutions helps overcome isolation and opens up professional opportunities. While he is not fully aware of existing policies affecting immigrants, he acknowledges the benefits of programs such as college career fairs and stresses the importance of networking. In conclusion, the participant's journey highlights the complexities of migration for highly skilled professionals, including devaluation of foreign credentials, cultural adaptation, economic pressure, and the need for strong community support and strategic planning.",

      "The participant is a 74-year-old male originally from Ghana with a rich professional background in accounting, IT auditing, and consultancy. He holds a master's degree and is a fellow chartered accountant with qualifications obtained in Nigeria. Prior to his relocation to the United States, he enjoyed a distinguished career in Nigeria, having worked with several high-profile organizations, including the Central Bank, NNPC, and Federal Inland Revenue Service. He also co-founded and chaired a successful accounting firm. His decision to migrate to the United States was driven primarily by a desire to reunite with his wife and son, both US citizens residing in Maryland. However, despite his extensive experience and qualifications, his transition into the American professional environment was marked by considerable challenges. Upon arriving in the US, the participant discovered that his qualifications were not recognized without further certification. He noted that American systems required licensing such as the CPA and certification in American taxation law—requirements that did not exist in his home country. These barriers were compounded by his age and the implicit ageism he encountered in the job market. Despite being highly skilled and knowledgeable, his applications were often ignored, and he faced subtle workplace discrimination based on race and age. Cultural differences added to his difficulties. He struggled with differences in workplace expectations, social interaction norms, and a general lack of recognition for foreign-acquired experience. Nevertheless, he made concerted efforts to integrate by volunteering with professional organizations such as ISACA, AARP, and NSRTF, which helped him maintain engagement and relevance in his field. He also actively contributed to community development through church networks and mentoring. Professionally, he found that only a fraction of his skills and qualifications were being utilized. While he has adapted to his environment, the process has been emotionally and economically demanding. He spoke of the frustrations of having to 'start over' despite an illustrious career, and the heavy burden of family financial obligations through remittances. In terms of navigating cultural duality, he acknowledged the tension between African cultural expectations and American norms. He cited challenges such as differences in communication styles, greetings, and social etiquette, which required conscious adaptation. He expressed concerns about losing touch with his roots while also recognizing the necessity of adapting to his host environment. The participant recommended that African educational institutions revise their curricula to align with international and practical standards, including more internship and hands-on training. He also suggested that American institutions and policymakers develop more inclusive policies that accommodate the professional backgrounds of highly educated African immigrants. In conclusion, while he appreciates the opportunities the US offers, he remains emotionally connected to his home country. He views the US as a place to earn and return, not to settle permanently. He encourages others to approach migration with realistic expectations and to remain grounded in their identity and purpose. Despite the many obstacles, he maintains a hopeful and reflective outlook, advocating for both reform in African education systems and greater inclusion within American immigration and employment frameworks.",

      "The participant, a 57-year-old Nigerian man with a master’s degree obtained in the United States, shared his migration journey, professional background, and experiences integrating into the American society. Formerly a Chief Hospital Administrator in Nigeria with over two decades of professional experience, he moved to the US primarily to provide his children with access to quality Western education and to escape security and political challenges associated with his senior government position. His transition to the US began with postgraduate studies at Delta State University in Mississippi, sponsored by the Lagos State Government. However, after experiencing difficulties, including high health insurance costs and professional limitations, he relocated to Maryland, which he found more suitable for his family's educational and social needs. Upon arrival, he faced several challenges, including immigration-related issues, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which complicated his residency process. Professionally, despite his vast experience and qualifications in healthcare administration, he encountered significant barriers. These included limited recognition of his foreign credentials, workplace discrimination, communication difficulties due to accent differences, and age-related bias. Although he became a program coordinator in a health service organization, he expressed frustration that his skills and decision-making abilities were underutilized compared to his previous roles in Nigeria. Culturally, he adjusted relatively well, attributing this to prior visits to the US and strong African and Christian communities in Maryland. Nevertheless, he initially struggled with cold weather, dietary shifts, and adapting to the local pace of life. His professional interactions were sometimes strained by racial and linguistic biases, with fewer opportunities to attain leadership roles in healthcare despite his qualifications. Economically, he felt the financial strain of living in the US, particularly when juxtaposed with his more stable financial standing in Nigeria. The pressure to remit funds to extended family members in Nigeria added to this burden. To manage, he adopted a budgeting strategy, took on multiple jobs, and deliberately avoided direct money transfer apps, instead coordinating remittances through his wife to reduce expectations and avoid frivolous requests. In terms of support networks, the participant highlighted the importance of religious and Nigerian community groups in helping him settle and navigate American systems. These networks provided essential information, emotional support, and a sense of belonging. He recommended that highly educated Nigerian immigrants adopt an open-minded approach to career transition, including the possibility of changing professions to adapt to the US job market. He emphasized the need for American policies and programs, especially in Maryland, to better accommodate and utilize the expertise of foreign-trained professionals. He advocated for platforms that amplify the voices and experiences of immigrants without fear of stigma or retribution. In conclusion, while the participant has managed to adapt to life in the US, he continues to grapple with underemployment and systemic barriers. Nonetheless, he remains hopeful that with the right policies and support systems, the wealth of experience held by African professionals can be better harnessed for mutual benefit.",

      "The participant is a Nigerian woman pursuing a PhD in Public Health at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. Prior to relocating to the United States in 2022, she earned her BSc and MSc degrees in Food Technology from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, and spent a decade as a lecturer at the Federal Polytechnic, Auchi. Her migration was facilitated by Nigeria's Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), which supported her desire for academic advancement—a goal she had postponed due to financial constraints back home. Upon arrival, she faced several challenges, particularly the shift from food technology to public health, a field outside her original academic training. Adapting to the new discipline was difficult at first, as was understanding the American accent and academic culture. She also encountered constraints imposed by her F-1 visa status, which restricts off-campus employment. Although some international students bypass these restrictions, she adheres strictly to regulations and currently does not work. Despite the shift in disciplines, she sees continuity between food technology and public health, particularly in areas like food safety and nutrition. She actively participates in professional organizations such as the American Public Health Association and the Association of State Public Health Nutritionists, and regularly attends seminars and workshops to update her knowledge. Cultural adjustment presented another layer of complexity. She recounted humorous and sometimes awkward experiences involving American customs, language use, and social etiquette, such as misunderstanding cold-weather behavior or making culturally inappropriate remarks due to unfamiliarity with American norms. These experiences highlighted her need for cultural orientation and language support, which she believes would ease integration for new immigrants. She also reflected on differences in family dynamics and care structures between the US and Nigeria. In Nigeria, she noted, families tend to remain closely knit across generations, whereas in the US, children gain independence earlier and family members often live apart, sometimes resulting in loneliness for the elderly. Economic pressure from family back home adds another layer of difficulty. She expressed frustration at the unrealistic expectations of relatives who assume wealth comes easily in America. She has made a point of clearly communicating her student status and financial limitations to manage these expectations and reduce the pressure of remittances. Regarding systemic challenges, she criticized the limited recognition of foreign qualifications, noting that professionals from Nigeria often must repeat training or pass numerous exams to meet US standards. She called for policies that support international credential recognition and suggested pre-arrival language training and cultural orientation workshops for new immigrants to ease transitions. In conclusion, while the participant values the academic and professional opportunities she's received in the US, she continues to face cultural, financial, and institutional barriers. Her experience underscores the importance of support systems—both institutional and social—as well as structural reforms that better accommodate the qualifications and realities of international students and immigrants.",

      "The participant, a 34-year-old Nigerian-born woman, currently works as a licensed physical therapist in Maryland. Though born in the US, she was raised in Nigeria, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in medical rehabilitation from Obafemi Awolowo University. She returned to the US eight years ago, motivated by economic instability in Nigeria and a desire for professional advancement and family reunification. Maryland was a deliberate choice due to its more immigrant-friendly credentialing system. Upon arrival, she pursued physical therapy licensure, a process that involved transcript evaluations, course equivalency reviews, additional coursework, and passing a rigorous board exam. Despite the initial adjustment, she completed this transition in about 18 months. Her foreign credentials were recognized, but adapting to the American board exam system required considerable effort. In Nigeria, her career trajectory followed a clinical-to-academic path, whereas in the US, it is shaped by specialization and work setting. She now works in outpatient and geriatric care, supervising assistants and feeling her skills are well-utilized. While she did not face overt discrimination, she noted that subtle biases and accent-based assumptions exist. However, she believes that competence and professionalism lead to acceptance. Credentialing success, she emphasized, depends on the applicant's diligence and the preparedness of their alma mater. She collaborated with Nigerian lecturers to ensure that her course descriptions met US standards. Cultural adaptation was eased by courses in multicultural competence, supportive professional and faith-based networks, and mentorship through her alumni association and the 'Challenge' initiative. Balancing Nigerian communal obligations with America's individualistic culture posed challenges. She continues to support family and friends back home but sets clear boundaries to avoid burnout. Time management and a strong support system help her juggle multiple roles and responsibilities. She commended the US system for rewarding excellence, though recognition can be slow. She advocated for Nigerian institutions to align programs with global standards, especially now that physical therapy has been upgraded to a doctoral-level qualification. She also recommended that the US offer scholarships, increase immigration quotas for African professionals, and implement more accessible pathways for skilled immigrants. Her journey illustrates resilience, adaptability, and a proactive cultural and professional integration approach. She calls for stronger institutional support in Nigeria and the US to better bridge the gap between African-trained professionals and Western labor markets.",

Her migration was prompted by escalating insecurity in Nigeria, economic hardship due to currency depreciation, and threats to her family's safety and investments. With children already in the US, and her parents and brother residing in Maryland, the decision to settle there was both familial and practical. Upon arrival, she faced cultural shocks and professional setbacks. Despite her qualifications, she found it difficult to secure equivalent employment and had to restart her career, taking up work as a caregiver and launching a small business. She now works in the health sector and sees this shift as an opportunity to learn new skills and possibly pursue entrepreneurship. She emphasized the underutilization of foreign qualifications and the lack of structured information for immigrants. Nonetheless, she sees value in every skill and leverages her professional knowledge to add value in her current roles. Discrimination was minimal in her work setting, though she noted bias from African Americans during her housing search. Her resilience and openness to learning, supported by strong family ties, faith community, and active networking, have been crucial to her adaptation. Culturally, she experienced challenges in adjusting to American norms, particularly around family dynamics and social etiquette, but she remains focused on her goals. Economically, she juggles multiple shifts to manage high living costs and meet the demands of supporting family and charitable commitments back home. She recommends that Nigerian immigrants prepare thoroughly before migrating, embrace career flexibility, and leverage available resources. She strongly believes in community-led support systems and the importance of building one's own opportunities rather than waiting for institutional help.

      "The participant, a 51-year-old Nigerian woman, migrated to Maryland, USA, approximately 15 years ago. She holds a PhD, and her educational background is split between Nigeria (bachelor's and master's degrees) and the United States (MBA and PhD). Prior to migrating, she was a lecturer at a polytechnic in Nigeria for 18 years. Her relocation was initially intended as a short visit to spend time with her husband, a student in Maryland. However, due to a providential encounter and encouragement to pursue further education, she stayed and commenced a PhD program. Her migration experience was marked by significant challenges, including financial constraints, lack of mentorship, and limited awareness of career-enhancing opportunities such as internships and OPT/CPT programs. Childcare and transportation difficulties also compounded her early struggles. Despite these, she gradually navigated her path through resourcefulness and the eventual support of a few individuals and institutions. Professionally, she began working in the US as a writing fellow and adjunct lecturer, eventually taking on administrative roles. She also taught in a prison education program and did care work during the pandemic. While her qualifications often exceeded job requirements, she noted that her roles did not always fully utilize her skills. Despite subtle biases and initial skepticism due to her accent and background, she gained recognition and awards for her work, demonstrating competence and earning respect. Culturally, she encountered difficulties adjusting to the more individualistic American lifestyle, contrasting it with Nigeria's communal culture. She struggled with social isolation, different norms around child-rearing, and unfamiliar expectations in academic and professional interactions. A turning point in her integration came through a serendipitous reconnection with a high school acquaintance who offered significant support. The participant emphasized the importance of networking, mentorship, and structural support for African immigrants. She advocated for a shift in mindset among Nigerian immigrants—from focusing solely on financial gain to aspiring toward positions of influence. She highlighted the value of programs like the American Association of University Women (AAUW), whose scholarship enabled her academic progress and inspired her to mentor others. She called for stronger community support structures, re-orientation around long-term goals, and collective efforts to uplift African immigrants professionally and socially. Overall, her story illustrates resilience, the transformative power of support systems, and the critical role of informed guidance in successfully integrating highly educated immigrants.",

He holds two master's degrees—one in Information Technology from Nigeria and another in Project Management from the United Kingdom. Before relocating, he worked for 13 years in the Nigerian IT industry, rising to the position of Finance Manager. He moved to the US seeking economic advancement, believing that being in the American system would allow him to measure professional growth more effectively. He chose Maryland for its multicultural environment, which he felt would ease integration. Since arriving, he has been employed as a Direct Support Professional, working with individuals with behavioral challenges. He acknowledged that this role only partially utilizes his qualifications and hopes to transition into the IT field soon. Challenges encountered include difficulty finding work in his preferred sector and safety concerns that limit social engagement. While he has faced some workplace discrimination, he chooses not to dwell on it, instead maintaining a positive attitude and focusing on building connections with supportive individuals. His previous experiences in the UK and Canada contributed to smoother cultural assimilation in the US, and his social circles—primarily fellow Nigerians—have further eased this transition. He has no strong ties to formal community or professional networks but draws support from his school union and close friends. Economically, he faced initial struggles due to limited income but has since balanced responsibilities, including remittances, through careful budgeting and saving habits. For highly educated Nigerian immigrants, he recommends associating with career-oriented individuals, simplifying the certification process, and introducing policies that allow professionals to work under supervision while pursuing licensure.

She holds an HND (bachelor’s degree) in Accountancy and relocated due to economic instability, job insecurity, and escalating security threats in Nigeria, including near-kidnapping experiences. In the US, she transitioned into the healthcare sector, not out of interest but necessity, in order to support her children through college. Although she uses some of her professional skills—such as documentation—in her current job, she acknowledges that her qualifications and vast experience are underutilized. She expressed interest in becoming a tax consultant and emphasized the need for accessible, affordable credential conversion and guidance services for skilled immigrants. Her migration journey marked her logistical and social challenges, including limited support systems and conflicting or discouraging information from initial contacts. She has not relied on community organizations or formal networks; instead, she depends on a few meaningful individual relationships for information and support. Cultural adaptation requires adjustments in communication style, lifestyle habits, and understanding of social norms. She noted the structured nature of American life, contrasting it with the informality of Nigerian society. Financial pressures, especially related to bills and remittances, were significant but manageable through careful planning and prioritization.

He held various roles, culminating as Deputy Director of Accounts at the Ondo State House of Assembly, but political interference and professional marginalization led to his early exit. Initially visiting the US for vacation, he eventually settled in Maryland—partly drawn by familiarity with the name 'Maryland' from Lagos. Transitioning to life in the US was difficult; he recounted his dismay at being offered factory work despite his decades-long professional background. Eventually, he took a role as a caregiver for individuals with disabilities and currently serves as a house manager. Though vastly different from his accounting background, he finds fulfillment in this new career and plans to pursue further studies in healthcare.

He highlighted stark differences in work ethics and accountability between Nigeria and the US, especially regarding punctuality and direct access to leadership. Upon arrival, he experienced no formal support networks and stressed the need for accurate information and orientation for new immigrants. He sends financial support back home, particularly for education and health, though he avoids social remittance obligations. He advocates for reduced tuition fees and greater sensitization programs to help immigrants re-enter education and rebuild careers in the US.

Currently working as a Direct Support Professional (DSP) and a Certified Medical Technician (CMT), she cares for individuals with developmental and intellectual challenges.

Upon arriving in the US, Participant 13 encountered significant challenges transitioning professionally. Despite evaluating his credentials through WES and securing their US equivalence, only one of his qualifications has been marginally useful. He initially took jobs in security and later moved into law enforcement. He describes a lack of skill transfer and intellectual independence in his current roles and expresses frustration with the limited recognition of his experience and professional voice. He relies mainly on his listening and writing skills, while other competencies remain untapped. He reports experiencing subtle racial or accent-based discrimination, particularly in communication. People often pretend not to understand him, compelling him to constantly rephrase statements. However, he remains committed to maintaining his accent, emphasizing that he communicates in grammatically correct English. Culturally and socially, he expresses disappointment in the Nigerian immigrant community's lack of cohesion and support. He criticizes alumni associations and professional networks for being self-centered and failing to assist struggling members. He believes social and career integration should be supported through intentional, collective efforts, such as sharing job opportunities and pooling resources, drawing inspiration from the communal strategies employed by other immigrant groups like Indians and Asians. He speaks critically of the erosion of African communal values among immigrants, attributing many social issues—including family breakdowns and disconnection—to the loss of traditional support systems. He advocates for mutual assistance, skill-sharing, and economic cooperation as pathways to collective advancement.

In the US, he operates a self-run export business and supplements his income with ride-share services such as Uber and Lyft. Before migration, he held various managerial roles in Nigeria’s public and private sectors, including work with the Imo State Environmental Protection Agency and a consulting firm managing government projects. His decision to migrate was driven by a mix of economic hardship, political instability, and especially worsening insecurity in Nigeria. He arrived in 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented immediate challenges, including social isolation, lockdowns, and cultural disorientation. Adjusting to a new lifestyle, climate, food, and professional environment posed additional difficulties, especially considering the stark contrast between his former status and the entry-level nature of most immigrant jobs. Participant 14 noted that integrating professionally has been challenging. Despite his qualifications, his Nigerian credentials carry little weight in the US job market, and accent bias during interviews often serves as an unspoken barrier. He has faced subtle workplace discrimination and cultural misunderstandings but attributes his resilience to the toughness and adaptability developed through life in Nigeria. Although he is now pursuing local certifications to improve his prospects, he believes the system favors US-educated candidates, leaving many skilled immigrants underemployed. He observes significant cultural differences, especially in social norms and workplace interactions. For example, a gesture of respect he extended to an older colleague—common in Nigeria, was misinterpreted as mockery in the US, highlighting the need for cultural navigation skills. Nevertheless, the large Nigerian and African diaspora in Maryland has helped ease the transition to some extent. He points out a lack of accessible support systems tailored to African immigrants. Though he was contacted by Upwardly Global, an organization offering professional integration services, he laments that such resources are not widely known or visible. He advocates for government and community-based support systems that offer financial aid, career coaching, and cultural integration assistance. Importantly, Participant 14 highlights the burden of transnational family responsibilities. Known as the 'family tax,' this expectation compels immigrants to support extended family back home, often leading to burnout and mental health issues. He emphasizes the need for culturally sensitive mental health advocacy, especially given the stigma surrounding therapy in African communities. In conclusion, he calls for targeted policies, community outreach, and nonprofit initiatives that support the career advancement and psychological well-being of African immigrants, particularly in high-density areas like Maryland.",

Language has not been a barrier, and he reports no experiences of discrimination. Instead, he finds satisfaction and positive interactions in his current role, often engaging in meaningful conversations with passengers from diverse backgrounds. Cultural adaptation has been relatively easy for him, thanks to his international background, supportive family and church community, and prior familiarity with the US. He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which played a significant role in his early settlement, offering emotional and material support.

Culturally, he experienced moderate social isolation but managed to navigate the transition through structured family routines and participation in diverse church communities. His professional background with expatriates helped ease cultural assimilation in the workplace, where he actively engages in corporate social activities. He noted the lack of effective support from Nigerian community networks during migration, citing a competitive and uncooperative environment. Instead, he relied on self-research and online resources to navigate challenges, including schooling, housing, and career positioning. These experiences inspired him to begin developing an online platform aimed at providing verified, accessible information for African migrants in the US. He highlighted the cultural tension between traditional Nigerian values and American norms, particularly in parenting and familial expectations. He also acknowledged the financial pressures of supporting the extended family in Nigeria but managed it based on his family’s capacity in the US Participant 16 praised the US for its merit-based system and legal protections, noting that opportunities exist for anyone willing to follow the rules. He strongly advocates for the creation of a centralized information hub for Nigerian immigrants in Maryland to address the significant knowledge gaps and improve their integration and success.",

      "Participant 17 is a 44-year-old Nigerian male and a licensed physician who migrated to the United States in 2012. Initially residing in Maryland for five years, he moved between states for medical training before returning to Maryland in 2021. He is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland Medical Center. His primary motivation for relocating was to pursue world-class postgraduate medical training, with economic benefits becoming a secondary factor. Maryland became his base due to his wife’s prior residence there and its moderate climate and accessibility. Though his migration was smoother than most—thanks to spousal support and existing family networks—he acknowledged the rigors of integrating into the US medical system, particularly the time-consuming process of licensing exams, qualifications, and gaining entry into medical residency. Participant 17’s US career journey began with pro bono research under the mentorship of a surgical oncologist, leading to positions in surgical and anesthesiology residency, a fellowship, and eventually a faculty appointment. His medical expertise has been fully utilized and strategically developed through goal-setting and a clear career roadmap. He aims to focus on health disparities and health administration in the coming decade. Despite his success, he has encountered subtle and overt forms of professional bias and cultural prejudice. He noted that immigrants, especially African professionals, are often presumed less competent until they prove otherwise. He emphasized the importance of emotional intelligence, strategic social navigation, and alliance-building over relying on promises of fairness, which he believes can be misleading in American professional environments. While he did not rely on community networks or immigrant support organizations, he recognized their existence but also warned of potential exploitation. He advised future immigrants to have a clear plan—whether education, employment, or family unification—and to be wary of unregulated pathways. In terms of cultural adaptation, Participant 17 discussed the need to adjust social behaviors, especially in workplace interactions. He also emphasized the importance of understanding unspoken legal and social norms in the US, such as those surrounding conflict, alcohol, and law enforcement, which differ sharply from norms in Nigeria. He has adopted a structured approach regarding remittances and family expectations, prioritizing basic needs over luxuries and drawing clear boundaries. He emphasized that immigrants must also take care of themselves and avoid financial overextension to meet unrealistic demands from family in Nigeria. Participant 17 concluded with reflections on systemic issues in Nigeria, noting that US systems work because of structure, not benevolence. He believes highly skilled Nigerians should consider using their overseas experience to return and address Nigeria’s challenges, particularly in healthcare and infrastructure, rather than seeing permanent relocation as the only solution.",

      "Participant 18 is a 56-year-old Nigerian male with dual degrees in economics and business administration. He has lived in the US, specifically Maryland, for about seven years, having previously visited for holidays. Currently, he works as a community coach in the mental and disability health sector, supporting individuals with learning disabilities and mental health conditions. Before migrating, he held a prestigious position as a marketing and sales manager for a large plastic manufacturing company in Nigeria. His motivation for relocating was driven by aspirations for a more stable economy, career advancement, and better opportunities, factors he felt were lacking in Nigeria due to political instability, unreliable infrastructure, and economic decline. Despite his professional experience and qualifications, he found that his Nigerian credentials were not recognized in the US, leading to a dramatic career downgrade. Upon arrival, he faced challenges with professional integration, cultural adaptation, and emotional dislocation from friends, family, and social life. The transition from managing large teams in Nigeria to working in a support role he deems academically and professionally unchallenging has been particularly demoralizing. He described his current role as degrading and far below his skill level, citing institutional discrimination, lack of professional respect, and a lack of opportunity to contribute meaningfully in the workplace. Culturally, Participant 18 highlighted the differences between African and African American social values, particularly regarding religion, community, and social engagement. The lack of African or Nigerian support networks in Maryland has made his integration more difficult, and he emphasized the absence of structured guidance for newcomers. He lamented the minimal support from religious organizations and called for the establishment of African-led community groups that could provide newcomers with practical orientation, mentorship, and access to vocational training and resources. In terms of remittances, he supports family back home using what he refers to as the 'comparative advantage' of the favorable dollar-to-naira exchange rate. However, he stressed that any financial assistance is given only after meeting his needs in the US, as he remains financially constrained due to his low-wage job. Participant 18 criticized the lack of inclusive government policies in the US that recognize foreign degrees and professional experience. He argued for expanded access to student loans, affordable education, and recognition of foreign qualifications for skilled immigrants. He also pointed to the need for extending social benefits—such as food stamps, public transportation subsidies, and health insurance—to legally residing immigrants to ease their economic burden and support their development. Ultimately, Participant 18’s story reflects the disappointment and underutilization faced by many highly educated African immigrants in the US. He called for systemic changes both in the US immigration and integration policies and within African diasporic communities to improve the settlement experience and long-term prospects of newcomers.",

She migrated to the United States in 2018 through the Diversity Visa (DV) lottery alongside her husband. The family initially settled in California but relocated to Maryland so that her husband, a lawyer, could pursue a program for foreign-trained attorneys at the University of Baltimore. In Nigeria, Participant 19 had a 14-year career in accounting, working in both private and public sectors, including a senior role with the Lagos State Government. Upon arriving in the US, she encountered the common challenge of having her foreign qualifications unrecognized, which required her to return to school, complete a US master's degree, and pass American board certification exams before she could resume her professional career. She began her US career in an audit firm, including work with Price Waterhouse Coopers, before securing her current position as an accountant and supervisor with the State of Maryland. While she values the opportunity to continue in her profession, she notes that her current role is narrowly focused on accounts payable, and she feels that her full range of skills and experience is underutilized. Nevertheless, she appreciates the emphasis on specialization and technology in the US accounting system. Participant 19 has not faced direct workplace discrimination, attributing this to her strong performance and professional competence. However, she acknowledges the pressure immigrants often feel to prove themselves to be accepted and respected. Culturally, she has adapted by integrating positive values from both Nigerian and American societies, choosing what works best in her personal and professional life. Socially, her initial integration was supported by a church community in Maryland, which helped her navigate local systems and settle into life without any pre-existing networks. She has not experienced major economic challenges related to remittances, explaining that she prioritizes responsibilities based on importance and within her financial limits. She critiques the US system for its limited recognition of foreign credentials and suggests that the process of validating foreign qualifications should be improved and streamlined to better support skilled immigrants. She believes more inclusive policies and support structures would help talented professionals from Africa contribute more effectively to the US economy. Her final advice to other highly educated immigrants is to stay focused, ignore distractions, and persist in their professional goals, even when faced with discrimination or pressure to change fields. Her story exemplifies resilience, adaptability, and professional continuity in the face of migration-related challenges.",

Prior to migrating, he worked extensively in Nigeria's IT and telecommunications sector for over 11 years, holding various roles such as field engineer, technical support engineer, business analyst, incident manager, and operations manager. The decision to migrate was driven primarily by economic factors, particularly the deteriorating standard of living in Nigeria, concerns about infrastructure, and the desire to raise future children in a society offering greater stability and opportunity. Though the visa application process was challenging, particularly securing an interview date, he and his wife successfully relocated. Upon arrival, they faced initial settlement difficulties, including adapting to the cold climate, currency devaluation, and high living expenses, compounded by the limited value of their Nigerian savings due to poor exchange rates. Professionally, Participant 20 has had to adjust to a more advanced and competitive US job market. While he hasn’t experienced workplace discrimination, he acknowledged the need to reorient himself professionally and obtain new certifications to stay relevant. He views this not as a barrier but as a necessary adaptation to meet higher standards. Despite this, he has not received support from any professional organizations or African community networks, noting a lack of structured systems for career advancement among African immigrants. Socially, cultural assimilation was smooth, thanks to preexisting relationships in Maryland. However, he remains aware of the cultural contrasts between Nigeria and the US, especially around values, family expectations, and social obligations. He continues to navigate pressures from relatives in Nigeria for financial remittances but maintains boundaries by giving within his means. Participant 20 emphasized the need for stronger professional support systems within the African immigrant community, beyond social gatherings, to share opportunities and resources that help newcomers succeed. He suggested more African-owned businesses and organizations should sponsor professional migrants and create structures like those seen in Indian and Asian communities. He called for a shift from competitive mindsets to collaborative, career-oriented support within the diaspora. In closing, he expressed gratitude for the opportunity to reflect on his migration journey and highlighted the importance of such dialogues in amplifying immigrant voices and experiences.",

He holds a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology from the University of Massachusetts Lowell and has lived in the US for approximately 18 years, over ten of which have been in Maryland. Before migrating, he earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Cape Coast in Ghana and worked as a research assistant at the same institution. His decision to migrate was motivated solely by a desire for advanced academic study. The US offered him the most suitable academic opportunities for his master’s and PhD programs, although he had also considered other countries like Canada and the UK. His move to Maryland was prompted by a job offer at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Professionally, he currently works as a health physicist. While the position aligns with his qualifications, it does not fully utilize the breadth of his academic and professional training, which includes backgrounds in physics, biomedical engineering, and health physics. Nonetheless, he chose this career path intentionally and continues to engage in academic research independently with former colleagues. Participant 21 has generally experienced a smooth integration process. He did not face significant migration challenges, though he acknowledged the financial struggles typical of international students. He emphasized that recognition of qualifications and licensing has not been a barrier in his field, although his current role does not require a PhD. He has experienced workplace discrimination, including being dismissed from a position under questionable circumstances and encountering professional sabotage from a fellow Black colleague. However, he chose not to pursue legal action and has since moved forward professionally. Culturally, he reports minimal adjustment issues. He embraces the values he was raised with in Ghana while adapting to his current environment. Socially, his primary support has come from church, which provided emotional encouragement but not material or career assistance. He recounted one meaningful instance when a pastor supported him financially during a difficult period as a student. In terms of dual responsibilities, Participant 21 actively supports his mother and extended family in Ghana. He sees this not as a burden but as a responsibility, one he shares openly with his wife, who is supportive. Reflecting on broader challenges among highly educated African immigrants in the US, he noted that unrealistic expectations, lack of professional opportunities, and insufficient support systems often result in disappointment. Many migrants face the reality that their foreign credentials are undervalued, and they may need to retrain or pursue unrelated jobs initially. He emphasized the need for African immigrants to remain patient, diversify their skills, and support one another. He criticized the limited impact of diversity and inclusion policies, which often benefit white women and Asians more than African immigrants. He urged for more genuine collaboration and mutual assistance within the African diaspora, highlighting mistrust, fear of being undermined, and competitiveness as obstacles to communal progress. Overall, Participant 21’s story is one of resilience, professional purpose, and a deep belief in the power of unity and shared growth among African immigrants in the US",

With a background in law and a master’s degree in Peace Studies and Conflict Resolution, she practiced alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in Nigeria for over 15 years, operating her own private practice in Abuja. Her move to the US was driven primarily by economic pressures, especially the rising cost of supporting children studying abroad and the pursuit of better opportunities and reunification with her husband, who had earlier relocated for work. Upon arriving in the US, she faced multiple challenges, notably culture shock and the inability to work immediately due to visa restrictions. Transitioning professionally has been particularly difficult. Despite her extensive qualifications and experience, she currently works as a community coach supporting individuals with disabilities—far removed from her field. She describes this career shift as frustrating, humiliating, and a stark underutilization of her skills. The complexity and financial burden of requalifying to practice law in the US, including the need for a US LLM and state-specific bar exams, serve as significant barriers. She also reported encountering frequent workplace discrimination, often being treated as unqualified despite her credentials. This has resulted in a pattern of short job tenures, none exceeding six months. Her experience of cultural differences extends to a perceived lack of empathy in American workplaces, especially during personal tragedies such as the recent death of her mother. Participant 22 highlighted the absence of meaningful support systems or community networks to aid immigrant professional integration and expressed disappointment in the lack of feedback from organizations she approached for volunteer opportunities in the legal field. She also struggles with the economic burden of remittances to family in Nigeria, feeling caught between cultural expectations back home and the financial realities in the US In terms of recommendations, she called for mechanisms that allow foreign qualifications to be evaluated and respected by employers, rather than disregarded. She emphasized the need for advocacy groups to push for systemic changes that can help highly educated immigrants better integrate into the US workforce.

Prior to migrating, he served as a medical officer in a state hospital in Lagos. His decision to emigrate was primarily driven by economic challenges and the search for better professional opportunities, which he believed the US could offer more than Nigeria or Europe. He initially settled in New York City but later moved to Maryland for a more family-friendly environment and proximity to his job in D.C. He described his migration experience as a “hard landing” due to the lack of practical support or guidance from those he initially lived with. Despite having accommodation upon arrival, he had to learn how to navigate American systems independently. His professional transition from Nigeria to the US was marked by frustration with the lack of merit-based career advancement in Nigeria, which he contrasted with the opportunity-driven structure of the US, where he has steadily progressed in his medical-related roles. Although he does not practice clinical medicine in the US, Participant 26 has consistently worked in healthcare-related positions that leverage his medical background, such as patient documentation quality assurance. He emphasized that his Nigerian training and new qualifications gained in the US have positioned him well to potentially return to direct patient care, should he choose to. On issues of professional integration, he faced some accent-related discrimination but overcame it through confidence and persistence. He described workplace licensing and credential recognition as manageable, especially since US institutions acknowledged his Nigerian qualifications after formal verification processes.

In Nigeria, he ran multiple businesses, including an Uber fleet and agricultural ventures, and also engaged in freelance content creation. In the US, he works as a Direct Support Professional (DSP) and as a contract site reliability engineer for small and medium enterprises. Motivated by economic insecurity and a desire for financial stability, Participant 27 left Nigeria for better opportunities, first in the UK and later in the US, where he saw greater potential for business and career growth due to its capitalist structure. His move to Maryland was influenced by its significant Nigerian community and existing personal connections. Despite his ambition and diverse skills, migrating presented deep emotional, financial, and relational challenges. The transition from being an independent business owner to starting over in a foreign land took a toll on his mental health and personal relationships. He described the US as a 'leveler' where everyone, regardless of past achievements, must start afresh. Participant 27 feels that his current DSP job underutilizes his talents, rating his skill usage at only 3 or 4 out of 10, while his engineering work, though intermittent, better aligns with his expertise. He expressed frustration with the US labor system's lack of recognition for foreign degrees and qualifications, which led him to pursue another degree in the US to overcome institutional skepticism and discrimination. He believes this distrust stems not only from systemic bias but also from the unreliability of some foreign certifications, especially from countries like Nigeria. Discrimination has been a recurring theme in his experience, manifesting across racial and ethnic lines—even among fellow Nigerians. He views discrimination as inevitable but chooses to endure it by staying focused on his goals, acknowledging the need for greater cultural awareness and systemic reform. Culturally, he integrates well due to his openness, global awareness, and ability to adapt. However, he emphasizes that religion, social norms, and unfamiliarity with local customs can hinder integration for many immigrants. He criticizes the lack of meaningful support networks, pointing out that most assistance comes from religious groups that often have ulterior motives, such as increasing their membership. Participant 27 feels a strong cultural obligation to support his family in Nigeria, which remains a motivating factor in his journey. Instead of viewing this pressure as a burden, he frames it as a source of strength and purpose, using it to push forward even during difficult times.

He transitioned from this background into a PhD program in genetics, successfully completing it in four years—ahead of the department average—and subsequently securing a position at Johns Hopkins.
